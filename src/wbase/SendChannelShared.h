/// A class that provides a SendChannel object with synchronization so it can be
/// shared by across multiple threads.
/// This class is now also responsible for assembling transmit messages from
/// mysql result rows as well as error messages.
///
/// When building messages for result rows, multiple tasks may add to the
/// the TransmitData object before it is transmitted to the czar. All the
/// tasks adding rows to the TransmitData object must be operating on
/// the same chunk. This only happens for near-neighbor queries, which
/// have one task per subchunk.
///
/// Error messages cause the existing TransmitData object to be thrown away
/// as the contents cannot be used. This is one of many reasons TransmitData
/// objects can only be shared among a single chunk.
///
/// An important concept for this class is '_lastRecvd'. This means that
/// the last TransmitData object needed is on the queue.
/// '_taskCount' is set with the number of Tasks that will add to this instance.
/// As each task sends its 'last' message, '_lastCount' is incremented.
/// When '_lastCount' == '_taskCount', the instance knows the '_lastRecvd'
/// message has been received and all queued up messages should be sent.
///
/// '_lastRecvd' is also set to true when an error message is sent. When
/// there's an error, the czar will throw out all data related to the
/// chunk, since it is unreliable. The error needs to be sent immediately to
/// waste as little time processing useless results as possible
